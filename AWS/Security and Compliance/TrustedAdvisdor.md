### AWS Trusted Advisor

It's a service that guides the provisioning of resources to follow AWS best practices

It scans your infrastructure and advises you on how it is or is not following AWS best practices based on five categories: cost optimization, performance, security, fault tolerance, service limits, and then it provides action recommendations to meet the best practices

#### Seven core Trusted Advisor Checks:

All AWS costumers have access to seven verifications for free

1. S3 Bucket permissions
2. Security Groups - specific ports unrestricted
3. IAM use
4. MFA on root account
5. Elastic Block Store (EBS) public snapshots
6. Relational Database Service (RDS) public snapshots
7. Service Limits
