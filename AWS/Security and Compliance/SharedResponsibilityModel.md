### Shared Responsibility Model

* Security of Cloud Computing infrastructures and data is a shared Responsibility between the customer and AWS

Example:

Security of the cloud is **RESPONSIBILTY OF AWS**

* AWS is Responsible for the security of the components that make up the AWS Cloud!

* AWS is responsabilty for physical security of data centers hosting in the AWS Cloud
* Security of hardware, software, networking, and so on that run the cloud computing services

BUT

Security IN the cloud is **OUR Responsibility:**

* We are responsible for varying levels of security functions depending on the Cloud Service we're using. Such as:
  * Protecting customer data and data encryptiong
  * Identity and Access Management
  * Patching operating systems of virtual machines (VMs)
  * Configuring firewalls

#### Security in the cloud:

* Identitiy and access management (IAM)
* Detective Controls
* Infrastructure protection
* Data protection
* Incident response
