### Amazon EKS

Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) is a fully managed Kubernetes service that makes it easy to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install, operate, or maintain your own Kubernetes control plane or nodes.

EKS provides the power of Kubernetes, an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, combined with the scalability, reliability, and security of AWS.

With EKS, you define your Kubernetes workloads such as pods, deployments, and services. EKS handles the availability and management of the Kubernetes control plane. It integrates smoothly with AWS services like IAM for authentication, ALB for load balancing, CloudWatch for monitoring, and ECR for container image storage.

EKS enables you to deploy and scale containerized applications seamlessly across AWS or on-premises using the same Kubernetes tools and configurations that you already know.


In one sentence it's simply: A fully managed Kubernetes service that simplifies running Kubernetes clusters on AWS by handling the entire control plane, ensuring high availability, scalability, and security, while allowing you to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications using standard Kubernetes tools integrated with AWS services like IAM, ALB, CloudWatch, and ECR.
