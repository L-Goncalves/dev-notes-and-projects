# What are AWS services?

AWS (Amazon Web Services) provides a broad set of cloud-based products and services including computing, storage, databases, networking, developer tools, and more. Below are brief descriptions of two commonly used AWS services:

## AWS CloudShell:

i'ts a browser-based, pre-authenticated terminal available directly within the AWS Management Console

Basically a terminal in the cloud free to use. (Not available in all regions)

* All files created in cloud shell remain created
* Very configurable (styling)
* You can download and upload files

## AWS EC2 Instance:

It's a service that provides resizable virtual servers in the cloud. Think of it as renting a computer that runs in AWS data centers, where you can run applications, host websites, and perform computing tasks.

## Amazon EKS:

Amazon EKS is AWS's way of letting you  **run Kubernetes clusters easily** , with less manual setup and more integration with AWS tools.

Amazon EKS is a **managed Kubernetes service** that makes it easy to run Kubernetes on AWS **without having to install, operate, or maintain** your own Kubernetes control plane or nodes.
