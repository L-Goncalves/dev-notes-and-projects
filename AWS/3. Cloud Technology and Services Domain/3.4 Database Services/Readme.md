### AWS Database Solutions:

### Fully managed or Manage your own?

The main considerations are:

* How much control do you need over your infrastructure
* How much do you want to automate and save money / time?
* Managed services will save you time and money but you lose control over your infrastructure!
* Spinning up an Amazon EC2 Instance to host your database gives you control but will require more active management
