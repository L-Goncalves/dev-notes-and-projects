### Amazon CloudFront

Amazon CloudFront is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers videos, data, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency and high transfer speeds. It leverages a distributed network of edge locations to cache content, ensuring that requests are served from the closest location to the user, improving load times and reducing server load.

For example, when using CloudFront to deliver a video, the video file is cached at multiple edge locations around the world. When a user requests the video, CloudFront routes the request to the nearest edge location, providing a faster and more seamless streaming experience. This reduces latency and minimizes the load on the origin server, ensuring efficient and scalable content delivery.
