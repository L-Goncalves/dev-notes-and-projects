### Deploying (Conceptual)

AWS users can create and manage resources into AWS in three ways:

* By utilizing AWS Management Console
* By utilizing AWS CLI (Command Line Interface)
* By utilizing AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs)

### AWS Management Console

This is basically the AWS Console Interface (console.aws.amazon.com)

* Graphical Interface that supports most AWS Services
* Can access billing statements, launch new services, check out health of web apps and more..
* "It's user friendly and easy to navigate"

### AWS Command Line Interface

* Access AWS services via the command line
* Command line: access and charge resources via text-based command entry
* Programming-language agnostic
* Create scripts to run on AWS.

You can also install AWS CLI with this tutorial: [Install CLI](../Setup/InstallCLI.md)

### AWS SDK

It's a programming interface so you can use AWS resources in existing projects.

Well this is already explained in this repository in [another file](../Setup/Sdk.md)
