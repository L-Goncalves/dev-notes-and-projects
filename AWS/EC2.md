## Amazon EC2

* EC2 is one of the most popular of AWS' offering
* ES2 means Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service.
* It mainly consists in the capability of:
  * Renting virtual machines (EC2)
  * Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
  * Distributing load across machines (ELB)
  * Scalling the services using an auto-scalling group (ASG)

### EC2 Sizing & Configuration Options:

* Operating System (OS): Linux, Windows or Mac OS
* How much compute power & cores (CPU)
* How much random access memory ( RAM)
* How much storage:

  * Network-Attached (EBS & EFS)
  * Hardware EC2 Instance Store
* Network Card: speed of the card, Public IP Address
* Firewall Rules: security group
* Bootstrap Script (Configure at first launch): EC2 User Data

### EC2 User Data:

* It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 User Data Script
* Bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts
* That Script is only run once at the instance first start
* EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
  * Installing Updates
  * Installing software
  * Downloading common files from the internet
  * Anything you can think of
* Any command run has the SUDO permissions


### EC2 Instance Types:
