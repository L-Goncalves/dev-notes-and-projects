# What is CI/CD?

* **CI = **Continuous Integration** → developers **frequently push code** (often daily) to a shared repository. Automated tools **check, build, and test** the code to catch bugs early.**

* **CD** = **Continuous Delivery** (or  **Continuous Deployment** ) → after code passes CI, it’s **automatically prepared for release** (delivery) or even **automatically deployed to production** (deployment), so new features or fixes go live quickly.

In short:

* **CI → test code often**
* **CD → deliver or deploy code automatically**

Example:

You push code → CI runs tests → CD pushes it to your app/server.
