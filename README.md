# What is this Repository About?

Iâ€™m passionate about Markdown files and about preserving as much of my knowledge as possible.  
Whenever I learn something new or study for certifications, I'll be actively updating this repository.

Think of it as **my personal knowledge base** â€” if it were possible to download my brain into a folder, this would be it. ðŸ˜…

### Current structure:
- **AWS**
- **Node.js**
- **React**
- **LeetCode Questions**
- *(and more coming soon)*

### Q: Why bother creating this if documentation already exists?

**A:** Over time, Iâ€™ll be turning these notes into articles for my portfolio.  
This repository is not just for reference â€” itâ€™s a way for me to internalize concepts, organize my learning, and share it with others.
