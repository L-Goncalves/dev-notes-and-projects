# What is this Repository All about?

Well, I very much like markdown files and I want to always retain as maximum knowledge as possible of what I know. When learning new things or studying for certifications I'll be actively updating this repo.

I want to keep this kind of like "My knowledge repository" as if it was possible to download my brain into thisðŸ˜…

For now it has the following structure:

* AWS
* NODE
* REACT
...

Q: But why this? why even bother if we have documentations? <br/>
A: Well, later down the road I'm going to be publishing articles based on these notes into my Portfolio.
