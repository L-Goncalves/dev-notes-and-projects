# Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms

If you are getting into programming or trying to improve your problem-solving skills, learning Data Structures and Algorithms is essential. It is the foundation of writing efficient code and building software that performs well at scale.

At the simplest level, Data Structures are about how you organize and store data. Algorithms are about how you process that data to solve problems. These concepts are not just academic theory. They are practical tools that make a real difference in the speed and efficiency of your code.

Every time you build something, whether it is a simple application, a complex system, or you are preparing for coding interviews, understanding DSA helps you think clearly, solve problems effectively, and write code that handles large amounts of data without breaking.

This repository is my personal collection of notes, explanations, and code examples related to DSA. The goal is to keep it beginner-friendly but still detailed enough for anyone who wants to develop a strong understanding of how things work behind the scenes.

If you are here to prepare for job interviews, sharpen your coding skills, or get a solid grasp of computer science fundamentals, this resource is for you.
