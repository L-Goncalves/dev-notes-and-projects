## Imperative vs Declarative Programming: What's the difference?

### Imperative

* Imperative programming is when you describe *how* something should be done, step by step.

### Declarative

* Declarative programming is when you say *what* you want, and the system figures out how to do it.


In Javascript for example a For loop is how you act imperative over a loop:

* You tell how it should be done through every iteration

Also, for declarative you can use **"native / built-in"** methods of the language, like **.reduce**, **.map** etc..
